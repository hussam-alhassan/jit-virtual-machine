(Currently W.I.P)

A stack-based bytecode VM with multi-arch JIT compilation 

Planned features:
- Tagged Objects
- Multi arch JIT targeting x86_64 & RISC-V

Instruction set:

- ADD
- SUB
- PSH?
- POP?
- STR?
- LOD
- DUP (because we often consume values)
- PRT (Output, but consume or from var?)
- ASC (Output in ASCII mode?)
- INC
- ; for comments
- @ for addresses
